### Easy Use
In the extension's pop-up, simply press the âž• icon to create a new chrome extension. Give your extension a name and description. Define what websites you want the extension to run on. Write vanilla JavaScript to define how the extension will run on these sites. Click the ðŸ’¾ icon to download the code for the extension, which is ready to be published on the chrome web store or further edited as you see fit.
